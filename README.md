This model decomposes the attention model and integrates various network features such as CNN, KAN, ResNet, and MLP. It also automatically adjusts the weights of each feature, achieving a super-set neural network capable of completing multiple tasks.

This model currently achieves Top1 accuracy rates of 98.5%, 91.7%, and 97.4% respectively on the ECG electrocardiogram data set, the cifar10 data set, and the EEG brainwave data set. The above text respectively covers the recognition tasks of high-noise one-dimensional data and two-dimensional images.
